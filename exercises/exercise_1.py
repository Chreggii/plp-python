## Define a class called book
## everytime it is instantiated, it prints a comment like: 'Hi There!  I am a Book!' 
## The class definition should also take a number as an argument which shows the number of pages and a string for the title
## Define three methods called open, read, close  which print "Open/Read/Close the Book {name of book}"
## Everytime you console print the object, the printed line should contain the book title and the number of pages
## Implement a class named BookReader which can be used as a context manager. In the __enter__ method should open the book and the __exit__ method should close the book.

## Once you are done, run the code below and check if the book are properly opened and closed.

# book = Book(500, 'Harry Potter')
